/* 
The general rules for naming variables are:

    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
    Names must begin with a letter
    Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
    Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
    Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
    Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
